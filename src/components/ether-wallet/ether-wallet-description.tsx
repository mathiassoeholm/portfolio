        My CS bachelor project, created in cooperation with Erik HÃ¸j Petersen. We developed an online cryptocurrency
        wallet that does not rely on trust to a third-party.

        The front-end was developed in React using the Material-UI framework.
        The backend was built with Node.JS and Firebase Cloud Firestore for storing data.
        We used Redux for state management and Redux Saga for handling side effects.
        Test-Driven development (TDD) reassured us that the code works and enabled refactoring which resulted in a clean code-base.
        Jest was used as testing framework.
