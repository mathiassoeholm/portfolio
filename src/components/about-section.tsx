            Hey there, Iâ€™m Mathias! I like building digital things that animate,
            look good and challenges me as a programmer. I have almost 10 years
            experience with developing highly polished mobile games and have
            shipped several titles in small and large teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            While completing my bachelors degree in Computer Science, I discovered
            that JavaScript was not all that bad and that building things in
            React is seriously awesome!
          </p>
          <p>
            React, TypeScript, Redux and WebStorm is now my favorite cocktail.
